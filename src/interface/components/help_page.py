        ## Getting Started
        
        This reliability analysis tool helps you analyze system reliability by:
        
        1. Building a system model
        2. Finding minimal cut sets
        3. Calculating system unreliability
        4. Running Monte Carlo simulations
        
        ### System Builder
        
        Use the System Builder to create your reliability system:
        
        - Add components with failure rates
        - Create connections between components
        - Use templates for common system types
        
        ### Cut Set Analysis
        
        The Cut Set Analysis page allows you to:
        
        - Find minimal cut sets using different algorithms
        - Compare algorithm performance
        - Visualize the minimal cut sets on your system
        - Generate unreliability expressions
        
        ### Simulation Analysis
        
        The Simulation Analysis page offers:
        
        - Monte Carlo simulation of system reliability
        - Statistical analysis of reliability metrics
        - Reliability plots with confidence intervals
        - Comparison with analytical solutions

            ### Reliability Theory
            
            **Minimal Cut Sets**: A cut set is a set of components that, when failed, causes the system to fail. A minimal cut set is a cut set that cannot be reduced further while still causing system failure.
            
            **Reliability Function**: The reliability of a system at time t is the probability that the system will function properly during the time interval [0, t].
            
            **Unreliability**: The unreliability (or failure probability) is the complement of reliability: F(t) = 1 - R(t).
            
            **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A statistical method that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results and estimate reliability metrics.

            ### Implemented Algorithms
            
            **MOCUS** (Method of Obtaining Cut Sets): A systematic procedure for determining minimal cut sets from a fault tree or reliability block diagram.
            
            **Binary Decision Diagrams** (BDD): A data structure that represents Boolean functions efficiently and can be used to find minimal cut sets.
            
            **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: A counting technique used to calculate the probability of the union of multiple events (used for exact unreliability calculation).
